# What I have learnt from the project
I have learnt that, in building a website involves skills like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some possible backends. Through this project, I have gained a knowledge and hands-on experience in these technologies.
From this project, I learnt that CSS can be used to make animations and also for styling a website. HTML just gives us what should be on the website. Whereas, CSS is for styling and making the website look more attractive.
